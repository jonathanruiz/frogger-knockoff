## Introduction
This is a knock off version of the classic arcade game Frogger! I coded it to help me further understand objects and classes which give me a better perspective of Object-Oriented Programming.


## How To Play
Use the arrow keys to move the player across the map. If you get hit by the lady bugs, you restart. Avoid the lady bugs and make it to the water and you win the game!
